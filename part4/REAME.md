Error Types 
------

+ Compiler - Compiler will catch these. These are the easiest type because you can fix them right now.
+ Runtime - These happen as the program in executing. They cause the program to crash.
    - Crashing is good because you know what is wrong and can fix it. Runtime is not ideal though, compiler is better.
+ Logical - These are errors that you introduce that cause the output to not be what you want. These are silent and generally hard to find
    - Programmically, these programs are correct (so they execute without issue), but logically they are wrong (so they produce the wrong result).
